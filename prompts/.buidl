# Execution Tracking & Benchmarks

This is how you should work.

## Progress Tracking

- Track completion rate in percentages
- Log milestones in .memory file
- Record time estimates vs actual completion time

## Quality Benchmarks

- Code quality metrics
- Test coverage requirements
- Performance targets

## Status Check

.memory file in root: track execution history
.overall file in root: overall project roadmap

## Start Execution

1. Pick next task from .overall
2. Implement with quality checks
3. Log progress to .memory
4. Run benchmarks if applicable

## Provide Status

1. Next 3 features in sequence
2. Current completion rate (%)
3. Time estimates for upcoming tasks
4. Blockers or dependencies
5. Quality metrics status

## Output Format

Ensure all output is:

- Previewable
- Properly formatted
- Contains concrete metrics
- Includes actionable next steps
