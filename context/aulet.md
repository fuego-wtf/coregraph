# **Part A: Bill Aulet’s Excerpt (Unchanged)**

A decade ago, entrepreneur and MIT Sloan educator Bill Aulet proposed a disruptive concept in the business world: disciplined entrepreneurship. In his 2013 book of the same name, Aulet assured readers that not only could entrepreneurship be taught, but his 24-step framework could help them learn it.

“Some people tell me that entrepreneurship should not be disciplined, but chaotic and unpredictable — and it is,” Aulet wrote. “But it is just in such situations where a framework to attack the problem in a systematic manner will be the most valuable.”

Now Aulet is offering “Disciplined Entrepreneurship: 24 Steps to a Successful Startup, Expanded & Updated.” In the following excerpt, Aulet, managing director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, outlines six themes that offer a proven general outline of how to create a sustainable innovation-based business.

This excerpt has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

### **Theme 1: Who is your customer?**  
It is crucial to start the process with the customer and work everything back from there. Brainstorm and identify how your idea/technology can serve a variety of potential end users.

As a startup, you have limited resources, and focus is essential. Select one market segment where you feel you have the highest odds of success while also giving you legitimacy and strategic assets to grow further.

Use primary market research techniques to build out a robust demographic and psychographic description of your end user. This keeps the focus on the end user, deepens your understanding of the primary customer, and calculates the total addressable market size for your beachhead market.

To make sure your beachhead market is not too big or too small, estimate the revenue per year you will get in your beachhead market if you achieve 100% market share.

Profile the persona for the beachhead market by identifying one actual real end user in your beachhead market who best represents your end user profile. This creates great focus in your organization and serves as a touchstone for all decisions going forward.

Create a list of the next 10 customers after the persona who closely fit the end user profile. This validates the persona and all the assumptions you have made so far.

### **Theme 2: What can you do for your customers?**  
Describe the full longitudinal experience of the persona and what opportunity there is for improvement. This will provide invaluable information for future steps to create specificity with regard to solutions, value, and accessing the customer.

Create a visual description of the product as well as a simple draft brochure, landing page, or digital representation of the proposed product. You need to make sure your team and the customer all have a common agreement on what the product is.

Summarize in as concrete a way as possible the value your product will create for the target customer. Customers buy based on value; it needs to be clear that you can show it.

Determine the single thing that you will do better than anyone else that will be very difficult for others to copy. Having a clear definition of your core will allow you to focus your limited resources to build and reinforce it.

Represent visually your position relative to the other alternatives in the persona’s top two priorities. Customers don’t care about your “core,” but they do care about benefits relating to their priorities.

### **Theme 3: How does your customer acquire your product?**  
Determine all the people who are involved in making the decision to acquire your product — including influencers. This starts the process to determine the cost of customer acquisition.

Detail how the decision-making unit decides to buy your product. This will be critical input to determine the length of the sales cycle and identify critical bottlenecks in the process.

Visually map the short-, medium-, and long-term way you will create and fulfill demand for your product. This will be critical input to calculating the cost of customer acquisition over time.

### **Theme 4: How do you make money off your product?**  
Review the different ways to get paid for your product and choose the best one aligned with all key stakeholders’ interests.

Determine a framework to test pricing for your new product and decide on what the initial price will be. Small changes in pricing can have a huge impact on your profitability.

Estimate the net present value of the total profits you will get from a new customer over the time period they will be your customer. To complete the unit economics, you now need to estimate and understand the drivers of the lifetime value of an acquired customer; it should get to at least three times the cost of customer acquisition.

Estimate the total marketing and sales expense in a given period to get new customers and divide this by the number of new customers. The unit economics are a simple but effective proxy for how sustainable and attractive your business will be as it scales.

### **Theme 5: How do you design and build your product?**  
Identify key assumptions to be tested before you begin to make heavy investments in product development. It will be faster and much less costly now to test the assumptions and allow you to preserve valuable resources and adjust as needed.

Test each of the individual assumptions you have identified. This scientific approach will allow you to understand which assumptions are valid and which ones are not and then adjust when the cost of doing so is much lower and can be done much faster.

Define the minimal product you can use to start the iterative customer feedback loop — where the customer gets value from the product and pays for it. You must reduce the variables in the equation to get the customer feedback loop started with the highest possibility of success with simultaneously the most efficient use of your scarce resources.

Offer your minimum viable business product to your target customer and obtain quantitative metrics regarding the adoption rate of the product, the value the target customer is getting from the product, and proof that someone is paying for the product. Numbers don’t lie. Show concrete evidence, and don’t rely simply on anecdotal evidence.

### **Theme 6: How do you scale your business?**  
Calculate the annual revenues from the top follow-on markets after you are successful in your beachhead market. It shows the potential that can come from winning your beachhead and motivates you to do so quickly and effectively.

Develop a longer-term plan to add functionality so you can address additional markets over time. It is important to think ahead and have a plan so your team is ready to keep moving forward after delivering the minimum viable business product.

# **Part B: Answering Aulet’s Themes for the 6-Stage Lean JS-Centric Plan**

Below, we **answer** each of Aulet’s themes (from Part A) **for your 6-stage project** that uses a simple JavaScript tech stack (Node.js, minimal front-end, etc.). We show how the themes apply at each stage (POC, working prototype, first deploy, first working product, stable v1.0, and investment/scaling).

## **1) “Who is your customer?” (Theme 1)**

**Across All Stages**  
- **POC & Working Prototype** (Stages 1–2):  
  - Brainstorm potential end users who have a direct pain your JS-based MVP can solve. Conduct **primary market research** with a small set of devs or teams if you’re building a dev tool.  
  - **Focus**: Pick one beachhead user persona who has the greatest immediate need for your Node/Express solution.  
  - Example: “Dev managers who want a small, cost-effective microservice to handle quick data transformations.”

- **First Deploy & First Working Product** (Stages 3–4):  
  - Refine the **persona**. Possibly create a quick doc describing “Sally the DevOps Manager,” or “John the small startup founder.”  
  - Gather feedback from actual pilot users who match that persona.  
  - “Create a list of next 10 potential customers” as a reality check that your user base is bigger than just 1–2 testers.

- **Stable Product v1.0 & Investment** (Stages 5–6):  
  - By now, you have a clear demographic and psychographic profile. Expand the user persona slightly if you see multiple market segments, but keep the *primary* persona front and center for continued focus.

## **2) “What can you do for your customers?” (Theme 2)**

**Across All Stages**  
- **POC & Working Prototype**:  
  - Show a “draft brochure” or a landing page built in **plain React or a static HTML**. Convey how your product solves the user’s biggest frustration.  
  - Summarize the top **value** in simple bullet points: e.g., “Saves dev teams 2 hours/week by automating X.”

- **First Deploy**:  
  - Let pilot users see a partial, **visual** representation (screen mockups, a small live preview) so they truly get the value.  
  - Confirm your “core” advantage: maybe a specialized Node plugin or a unique approach that’s hard to copy.

- **First Working Product & Stable v1.0**:  
  - Keep clarifying your unique selling proposition. Position yourself vs. alternatives or bigger incumbents.  
  - Always tie back to the user persona’s top 2 priorities, as Aulet suggests.

## **3) “How does your customer acquire your product?” (Theme 3)**

**Across All Stages**  
- **Working Prototype & First Deploy**:  
  - Identify the **decision-making unit**: If you’re B2B, do you need the CTO’s sign-off? Or is it an individual dev’s budget?  
  - Figure out any “influencers” (maybe a dev champion inside a small team).  
  - Map how you’d fulfill their needs short-term: e.g., share a Heroku link, Slack invites, or a license key.

- **First Working Product**:  
  - Understand the sales cycle length. If it’s small teams or individual devs, you might have a quick cycle. Larger orgs might require more steps.  
  - This is where you start to see how expensive it is to acquire one new user (Cost of Customer Acquisition) because you have a modest marketing approach (like dev community forums).

- **Stable v1.0 & Beyond**:  
  - Think about short-, medium-, and long-term marketing. Possibly a “freemium” tier if it’s a dev tool, or standard SaaS sign-ups.  
  - If it’s bigger enterprise deals, outline a more formal funnel.

## **4) “How do you make money off your product?” (Theme 4)**

**Across All Stages**  
- **Working Prototype & First Deploy** (Stages 2–3):  
  - Start testing pricing with a nominal monthly fee or a “pilot contract.” Even $50–$100 can confirm people are willing to pay.  
  - Estimate how many users you can get if you succeed in your “beachhead” niche. This frames your potential revenue.

- **First Working Product**:  
  - Refine the pricing structure. Possibly do seat-based ($X per dev) or usage-based (requests or CPU usage).  
  - Check the basic unit economics: “Lifetime Value” vs. “Cost of Acquisition.” If LTV < 3× CAC, the model might not be sustainable.

- **Stable v1.0 & Investment**:  
  - Lock in your final “SaaS tier” approach or “enterprise” deals.  
  - Ensure your net present value from each new user is healthy. If your main users are small dev teams, keep pricing straightforward but ensure margin.

## **5) “How do you design and build your product?” (Theme 5)**

**Across All Stages**  
- **POC & Working Prototype**:  
  - Identify the **critical assumptions** (e.g., “Users want a Node microservice that does X quickly?”). Test them with minimal code.  
  - Don’t build out 10 features; focus on a single or double assumption. Let the user try it as an “MVP” where you can gather data.

- **First Deploy**:  
  - The “iterative feedback loop” begins. Real pilot usage shows if your Node-based MVP is actually delivering the promised value.  
  - If it’s not, pivot quickly—still minimal code.

- **First Working Product & v1.0**:  
  - Keep using a *scientific approach* to test new features or assumptions. Example: “We assume advanced logging is top priority.” Build a quick test, confirm with actual usage metrics.  
  - This ensures you’re not over-engineering a giant platform but building the minimal product that users pay for.

## **6) “How do you scale your business?” (Theme 6)**

**Across All Stages**  
- **First Working Product**:  
  - Start planning expansions to next markets or bigger orgs. But do so only after you confirm the beachhead market truly loves your product.  
- **Stable v1.0**:  
  - Possibly build a road map for additional JS-based features or even alliances with other dev tools.  
  - Keep an eye on potential follow-on markets to justify your beachhead success.  
- **Investment & Scaling**:  
  - If your “Node microservice + small React front-end” solution proves successful in one vertical, replicate it to others—only once you have reliable revenue from your first segment.  
  - Plan additional features or expansions so you keep the momentum after delivering the minimum viable business product.

# **Conclusion: Merged Approach**

1. **Keep Bill Aulet’s Themes** as an **iterative backbone**:  
   - At every stage, ask: “Who’s the customer? How do we deliver real value? How do they find/buy it, and how do we ensure we’re profitable?”

2. **Apply Them to the 6-Stage Lean JS Plan**:  
   - **Stage 1–3** focus heavily on Problem-Solution Fit (Themes 1–2 for user understanding, Theme 3 for initial acquisition, Theme 4 for early pricing tests, Theme 5 for minimal product design).  
   - **Stage 4–5** refine the product into a stable v1.0, bridging to Product-Market Fit with more robust pricing (Theme 4), systematic approach to building (Theme 5), and a well-defined user persona (Theme 1) plus market expansions (Theme 6).  
   - **Stage 6** invests in real scale after proven traction in your core beachhead.

3. **Use a Simple JS Stack** (Node.js, minimal front-end) to remain agile:  
   - This approach **reduces complexity** so you can pivot quickly and test assumptions cheaply, exactly as Aulet’s framework demands.

By **answering Bill Aulet’s questions** (Part A) within the context of **your 6-stage lean plan** (Part B), you ensure you **don’t skip** any crucial step in *Disciplined Entrepreneurship.* You’ll systematically find **Problem-Solution Fit** (when the first paying users consistently adopt your minimal Node-based product) and eventually **Product-Market Fit** (when you see sustained traction, profitable unit economics, and readiness to scale).
