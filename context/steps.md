# Steps

Below is a **time-based plan** outlining each development stage, **what** you’re selling at that stage, **who** you’re selling it to, and **how much** you’re charging. Each milestone contributes to finding **Problem-Solution Fit** (first) and then **Product-Market Fit**. We’ll keep everything **lean**, so you’re not over-engineering or trying to build “Google in your backyard.”

## **Stage 1: Proof of Concept (POC)**

**Timeline:** ~2–4 weeks (rapid, super-lean effort)

### **Tech & Deliverables**  

- **Technology**: A simple script or micro-framework (e.g., Flask/Express).  
- **Infrastructure**: Possibly local environment or a single free-tier cloud instance.  
- **Output**: Core technical demo that *barely* proves feasibility.  
- **Key Milestone**: Confirm the major pain point can be solved, at least in a rudimentary way.

### **What Are You Selling?**  

- **Nothing direct** (you might not charge at POC stage).  
- Possibly you do **pre-sales** or “early access” signups for $0, or a small deposit ($10–$50) from a handful of *very* engaged testers.

### **Who Are You Selling To?**  

- **Early adopters** feeling the pain you aim to solve—likely personal contacts or an online dev community.  
- Typically <5 “champion” users or small teams who trust you enough to tinker with a POC.

### **How Much Are You Charging?**  

- **$0** or a **symbolic small deposit** if you want to gauge interest.  
- The real objective here is to confirm the **Problem** actually exists and get initial buy-in, not to maximize revenue.

### **Goal for Problem-Solution Fit**  

- Get potential customers to say, “Yes, this approach *could* solve my problem. I’d definitely pay for this once it’s more fleshed out.”

## **Stage 2: Working Prototype**

**Timeline:** ~4–8 weeks after POC

### **Tech & Deliverables**  

- **Technology**: Same micro-framework, maybe a minimal front-end (React, Next.js, or a static page).  
- **Infrastructure**: Host on a single free-tier or cheap tier (e.g., Heroku, Netlify).  
- **Output**: Interactive demo for 1–2 essential workflows.  
- **Key Milestone**: Real user feedback from a small pilot group.

### **What Are You Selling?**  

- A **prototype** that does *just enough* to solve a targeted pain point.  
- Possibly position it as an **“Alpha Access”** or “Prototype License.”

### **Who Are You Selling To?**  

- **Pilot testers** still from your direct network or niche communities.  
- People who need an immediate partial fix, are OK with bugs, and want to shape the product’s direction.

### **How Much Are You Charging?**  

- Could charge a **small monthly fee** ($20–$50/month) or a **one-time pilot fee**.  
- Purpose is to ensure 3–5 users *actually pay*, confirming **Problem-Solution Fit**.  
- If nobody is willing to pay a token amount, you might not have a real problem to solve.

### **Goal for Problem-Solution Fit**  

- Achieve at least **3–5 satisfied paying customers** who say, “This prototype solves my problem enough that I’ll pay for it, even in an alpha state.”

---

## **Stage 3: First Deploy**

**Timeline:** ~2–4 weeks after the prototype is stable

### **Tech & Deliverables**  

- **Technology**: Same stack as prototype, maybe a bit more stable.  
- **Infrastructure**: A single environment with a password-protected or invite-only approach for pilot users.  
- **Output**: A working environment that pilot users can access externally and test daily.  
- **Key Milestone**: Confidence that it’s not just a demonstration—users can run it in a real setting (even if small scale).

### **What Are You Selling?**  

- **“Pilot Deployment”** or “Invite-Only Beta” with limited seats.  
- Guarantee direct support from you or your small dev team.

### **Who Are You Selling To?**  

- **Early pilot customers** who rely on the solution for a fraction of their workflow.  
- Possibly small B2B teams or power users who want to “kick the tires.”

### **How Much Are You Charging?**  

- A **slightly higher** pilot fee or monthly subscription ($50–$100/month).  
- If you’re targeting businesses, consider a small pilot contract (e.g., $500–$1,000 for a 3-month pilot).  
- Must be enough to show user commitment but not so high that it scares away testers.

### **Goal for Problem-Solution Fit**  

- *Validate* the problem is truly solved in a real environment. Are pilot customers continuing usage for at least 1–2 months? If yes, you’re in solid territory for Problem-Solution Fit.

---

## **Transition: Problem-Solution Fit → Product-Market Fit**

Once you see that **3–5** paying customers (or a small pilot group) *love* the solution and continue paying, you’ve likely found **Problem-Solution Fit**. Next step: see if more *similar* customers exist (market demand).

---

## **Stage 4: First Working Product**

**Timeline:** ~4–6 weeks (post-first-deploy, *lean iteration*)

### **Tech & Deliverables**  

- **Technology**: Minimal expansions—still a monolithic codebase, maybe add 1–2 background jobs.  
- **Infrastructure**: Possibly upgrading to a small paid tier or a single GPU instance if AI is involved.  
- **Output**: A day-to-day product for pilot customers with:
  - **Core Feature Set**: At least 2–3 main features.  
  - **Initial Documentation**: Basic quickstart, user guides.  
  - **Performance Benchmarks**: “Good enough” speed for pilot usage.

### **What Are You Selling?**  

- A **“Pilot Production”** or “Early Adopter” version that solves the main user pain.  
- Could be subscription-based or small license-based if B2B.

### **Who Are You Selling To?**  

- The same pilot customers, plus **new referrals** from them.  
- Additional early adopters in your niche who want a workable solution, not just a prototype.

### **How Much Are You Charging?**  

- A more **consistent monthly rate** ($100–$300/month) if it’s a specialized B2B solution.  
- Or a tiered approach if you see different user segments:
  - **Individual**: $20–$50/month  
  - **Small Team**: $100–$150/month  
  - **Enterprise Pilot**: ~$500–$1,000/month

### **Goal for Product-Market Fit**  

- Expand from 3–5 paying users to **maybe 10–15** or more.  
- Track retention & usage: Are they staying month over month? Are they recommending you to others?

---

## **Stage 5: Stable Product v1.0**

**Timeline:** ~2–3 months after the first working product

### **Tech & Deliverables**  

- **Technology**: Hardening the code, adding basic monitoring/logging.  
- **Infrastructure**: Possibly a small cluster or single-tier scaling if usage grows.  
- **Output**:
  - **Robust Documentation**: Enough for new teams to onboard themselves.  
  - **Security & Compliance**: Basic user auth, HTTPS, safe data practices.  
  - **Maintenance Plan**: A Slack or support queue for user issues.

### **What Are You Selling?**  

- A **full subscription or license** for a “1.0 Production-Ready” solution.  
- Possibly tier-based pricing: Starter, Professional, Enterprise.

### **Who Are You Selling To?**  

- **A broader audience** in your target market. Not just pilots—**any** customers that fit the user persona.  
- Start exploring distribution channels, small marketing campaigns, or inbound funnels.

### **How Much Are You Charging?**  

- **Tiered Plans** based on usage or seats:
  - **Starter**: $50–$100/month  
  - **Professional**: $200–$500/month  
  - **Enterprise**: $1,000+/month with custom support
- Aim to see consistent revenue growth as new teams sign up.

### **Goal for Product-Market Fit**  

- If you’re consistently adding new paying customers, maintaining usage, seeing minimal churn, and hearing real user satisfaction, you’re nearing **full** Product-Market Fit.

---

## **Stage 6: Investment & Scaling Plans**

**Timeline:** Kicks in as soon as v1.0 shows stable usage or up to a few months post-release

### **Tech & Deliverables**  

- **Technology**: Expand only as usage demands (vertical scaling or a minimal container approach).  
- **Output**: A pitch deck, financial projections, bigger marketing/evangelism.  
- **Key Milestone**: Ready to raise funds or ramp up GTM (Go-To-Market) strategy once you see validated traction.

### **What Are You Selling?**  

- The **full solution** with public pricing tiers, plus potential “enterprise negotiations.”  
- Possibly custom deals if large companies require extra security or features.

### **Who Are You Selling To?**  

- **Wider market** beyond the pilot niche. Potentially global or cross-industry if your solution is broad enough.  
- **Investors** (VC, angel, etc.) if you choose to scale quickly.

### **How Much Are You Charging?**  

- Freed from “pilot constraints,” you can adopt standard SaaS pricing (e.g., $50–$500/month tiers, or $1k–$5k enterprise deals).  
- If heavily enterprise-focused, you might do annual deals in the **$10k–$50k** range as you scale.

### **Goal for Product-Market Fit**  

- Show consistent monthly revenue growth, *healthy retention*, and user enthusiasm.  
- If user feedback indicates a stable solution, with multiple expansions requested, you’ve likely got real **Product-Market Fit**.

# **Tying It All to Problem-Solution Fit and Product-Market Fit**

1. **Problem-Solution Fit**  
   - Achieved at or before the **“First Working Product”** stage, when you have **3–5 paying users** continuing to use your early solution.  
   - They confirm your product truly solves a painful problem.

2. **Product-Market Fit**  
   - Typically emerges around the **“Stable Product v1.0”** stage, when you see steady customer acquisition, retention, and willingness to pay.  
   - You have “enough” users who find your product essential, and growth becomes more predictable.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Keep everything lean**: minimal code, minimal frameworks, minimal infrastructure.  
- Always confirm **Problem-Solution Fit** before heavy marketing or large-scale engineering.  
- Once you see *enough* paying users sticking around, push toward **Product-Market Fit** with stable releases, broader marketing, and higher-tier pricing.  
- Expand your stack *only* when usage or paying customers demand it.

By following these **iterative, lean-focused** stages—and clarifying exactly **what you sell, to whom, and at what price**—you’ll systematically find Problem-Solution Fit first, then Product-Market Fit, without prematurely building a giant “Google in your backyard.”
