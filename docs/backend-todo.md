  - [x] Set up role-based access controls
  - [x] Add basic rate limiting with Fastify
  - [x] Configure secure environment variables (`.env` setup)

### Agent Management
- [x] Create agent CRUD endpoints
  - [x] `GET /agents` – Fetch all agents
  - [x] `POST /agents` – Create a new agent
  - [x] `GET /agents/:agentId` – Fetch specific agent by ID
  - [x] `DELETE /agents/:agentId` – Remove an agent
  - [ ] Integrate unit tests for agent CRUD operations

### Node Management
- [x] Implement node CRUD endpoints
  - [x] `GET /agents/:agentId/nodes` – Fetch all nodes for an agent
  - [x] `POST /agents/:agentId/nodes` – Add a node under an agent
  - [x] `GET /agents/:agentId/nodes/:nodeId` – Fetch specific node
  - [x] `DELETE /agents/:agentId/nodes/:nodeId` – Remove a node
  - [ ] Write integration tests for node operations

### Event Processing (Optional)
- [ ] Implement basic event ingestion pipeline
  - [x] Add `POST /agents/:agentId/events` – Log events under an agent
  - [ ] Write `GET /agents/:agentId/events` – Fetch paginated events
  - [ ] Include timestamp and type-based filters
  - [ ] Add database model for event logging

## Phase 2 - Real-Time System (Priority: High)

### Token Usage Savings
- [ ] Implement savings meter
  - [ ] Calculate and store token usage per session
  - [ ] Add `GET /usage` – Fetch token savings per user
  - [ ] Log savings to a `TokenUsage` database table

### Real-Time Event Streaming
- [ ] Implement Redis-based event streaming
  - [ ] Set up Redis pub/sub for real-time updates
  - [ ] Add WebSocket server for client connections
  - [ ] Implement basic event broadcasting
  - [ ] Add simple event persistence in Redis
  - [ ] Add reconnection handling for clients

## Phase 3 - Compliance & Enterprise Features (Priority: Medium)

### Compliance Features
- [ ] Implement sensitive data masking
  - [ ] Auto-detect sensitive fields in payloads
  - [ ] Mask data based on user role or access level
  - [ ] Write compliance logs for every masked request

- [ ] Create compliance audit endpoints
  - [ ] `GET /compliance/logs` – Fetch audit logs
  - [ ] Include user action trails (e.g., agent created, deleted)

### Enterprise-Grade Features
- [ ] Add role-based access control (RBAC)
  - [ ] Allow per-agent permissions
  - [ ] Add team and organization support
- [ ] Build on-premise deployment
  - [ ] Create a Docker Compose setup for enterprise environments
  - [ ] Write guides for deploying private Graphyn instances

## Testing & Quality (Priority: High)

### Unit & Integration Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for key modules
  - [ ] Clerk middleware validation
  - [ ] Token usage calculator
  - [ ] CRUD endpoints for agents and nodes
- [ ] Add integration tests for real-world scenarios
  - [ ] Memory processing pipeline
  - [ ] Event ingestion and retrieval

### Error Handling
- [ ] Add centralized error handling
  - [ ] Graceful response for uncaught exceptions
  - [ ] Detailed API error responses (e.g., validation failures)
- [ ] Integrate Sentry or a similar error-tracking tool

## Performance Optimization (Priority: High)

### Backend Optimization
- [ ] Reduce database query latency
  - [ ] Use indexes for common queries (e.g., userId, agentId)
  - [ ] Optimize joins for relational data
- [ ] Use Fastify hooks for efficient request handling
  - [ ] Pre-validation for common middleware patterns

### Scalability
- [ ] Enable Fastify clustering for multi-core usage
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed endpoints
  - [ ] Use Redis for agent and node cache

## Monitoring & Analytics (Priority: Medium)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Add logging for backend operations
  - [ ] Log API requests (e.g., endpoint, latency, status)
  - [ ] Store logs for debugging real-time failures
- [ ] Implement health-check endpoint
  - [ ] `GET /health` – Returns system and dependency status

### Usage Analytics
- [ ] Track key user actions
  - [ ] Agents created/deleted
  - [ ] Events processed
  - [ ] Memory nodes added/removed
- [ ] Add an admin dashboard for system metrics
  - [ ] Token usage trends
  - [ ] System uptime and error rate

## Documentation (Priority: Medium)

### API Documentation
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI documentation with Fastify Swagger
  - [ ] Include models for agents, nodes, and events
  - [ ] Add usage examples for each endpoint
- [ ] Create a "Getting Started" guide for API clients

### System Architecture
- [ ] Document the backend structure
  - [ ] Create system architecture diagrams
  - [ ] Document Redis pub/sub event flow
  - [ ] Add API endpoint documentation
  - [ ] Document deployment architecture
